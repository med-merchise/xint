This is the the initial release, first of the `0.1` series.

- Installs `sphinx` and some of its dependencies:
  + jupyterlab[docs,test]
  + ipdb
  + jupyterlab-code-formatter
  + myst-nb jupytext

  After installing `jupytext`, usually we disable Jupyter Notebooks' auto-save
  globally.  See why on the FAQ `"Jupyter warns me that the file has changed
  on disk" <jupyter-warn_>`__.
