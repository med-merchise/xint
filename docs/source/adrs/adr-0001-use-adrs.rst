ADR 1: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
===============================================


Status
------

Accepted


Context
-------

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.


Decision
--------

We will use ADRs as described by the `xit <xit-adr-1_>`__ project.

.. _xit-adr-1: https://github.com/med-merchise/xit/blob/main/docs/source/adrs/adr-0001-use-adrs.rst


Consequences
------------

This project will produce its own architectural documents, but also will
"inherit" ADRs from upper level projects.

Base namespace project:

  - `xit <xit-adrs_>`__

.. _xit-adrs: https://github.com/med-merchise/xit/tree/main/docs/source/adrs
